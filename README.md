# Sudoku-Solver-Android
An Android app that solves a sudoku board.

Author: Connor Seiden

This app is a sudoku solver that will take an incomplete sukdoku board and find the solution, if one exists.  It has a UI that allows users to enter the initial board state that they want solved.

The program finds the solution to a sudoku board through the use of a modified backtracking algorithm.  It recursively searches through valid board configurations until a complete, valid board is found.
